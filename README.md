# Code Style
* Add PhPDoc to explain your code
* Use 4 spaces to indent
* Keep indents on empty lines
* Curly brackets after statements should always be in the same line of code
* Don't do one-liner / don't keep them in a single line. Add newlines... (e.g. `if(abc){foo();}` )
* Keep curly braces after every statement, even if it's only one line (not `if(abc)foo();` but `if(abc){foo();}`)
* Do your code clean, modular and dynamic. Should be understandable though.
